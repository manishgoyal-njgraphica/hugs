                    You’re not. You’re being present. Concern isn’t panic, it’s care in its most powerful form. You know your child best. If something feels off, it’s worth exploring gently.

                     I’ve been told to “wait and watch”. Should I?

                    Sometimes waiting is wise. But sometimes, it delays help your child may quietly need. A gentle screening doesn’t force a path; it simply lights the way forward, if needed.

                    At HUGS, we don’t give children labels, we give them language. Tools. A sense of safety. If any terminology is used, it’s clinical, confidential, and always handled with care.

                    It doesn’t have to be. It can begin with something as simple as a conversation, an observation, or a play-based session. We adapt the process to your child’s pace, not the other way around.

                    This happens more often than you think. You're not overreacting. You’re responding. Sometimes it takes one parent to listen closely for a family to move forward together.

                    No. It will help uncover their strengths, soothe their struggles, and give them the tools to navigate the world. Your child remains who they are, just better understood.

                    If you’re asking that question, the right time might be now. Early doesn’t mean urgent; it just means open. Curious. Caring enough to check in early, not late.

                    Then that’s a wonderful thing to find out. Sometimes, children are just developing on their own timeline. A little clarity can bring a lot of calm, and even helpful tips for the road ahead.

                    We don’t start with talking. We start with trust. Play, movement, and stories, our approach is gentle and child-led. Many children don’t even realise they’re in “therapy.”

                    Yes. You don’t need a checklist or a diagnosis to walk in. You only need care. We’re here for conversations, clarity, and comfort, no strings, no pressure.
